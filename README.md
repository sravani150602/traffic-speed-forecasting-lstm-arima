#  Traffic Speed Forecasting using ARIMA & LSTM: A Deep Dive into Temporal Intelligence

##  Executive Summary

In the era of smart cities and autonomous vehicles, forecasting traffic speed accurately is a *mission-critical task*. This project is an advanced implementation of **Time Series Forecasting** combining the robustness of statistical modeling with the power of deep learning. Leveraging **ARIMA** for interpretability and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** for sequence learning, this pipeline simulates a real-world deployment of predictive modeling on traffic data.

The notebook simulates a full production-grade machine learning system, from ingesting raw zipped datasets to deploying trained models, complete with rigorous metric evaluation and explainability considerations.

##  What Makes This Project Stand Out?

-  **Dual-model framework**: ARIMA for interpretability, LSTM for high performance.
-  End-to-end **data preprocessing pipeline** from raw .zip files.
-  **In-depth EDA** uncovering spatiotemporal traffic behavior.
-  Real-time evaluation using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R²**.
-  **Model diagnostics and residual analysis** for ARIMA.
-  **Sequence modeling with TensorFlow/Keras LSTM** using lookback windows.
-  Fully reproducible **matplotlib/seaborn** visualizations.
## Business Relevance

Forecasting traffic helps in:

- Dynamic routing for autonomous vehicles  
- Real-time alert systems  
- Urban planning and congestion management  
- Logistics and last-mile optimization
